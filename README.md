# BinarySearchTree

Design a recursive algorithm, deduce the space and time complexity and then, author functions to do the following. For each of the problems below, assume you are given a Binary Search Tree where each node contains an integer data and links to the left and right children nodes.

- Search for a given integer value in the Binary Search Tree. Return true if the value is found, false otherwise.
- Insert a given integer value in the Binary Search Tree.
- Compute the height of the Binary Search Tree.
- Print values in the Binary Search Tree in pre-order.
- Print values in the Binary Search Tree in in-order.
- Print values in the Binary Search Tree in post-order.
- Print values in the Binary Search Tree in level-order. (Breadth-first traversal)
- Delete a given value from the Binary Search Tree.
